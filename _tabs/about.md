Hey, I’m Mikhail aka ErSilh0x - a cybersecurity expert with a passion for vulnerability management, penetration testing, and building smarter ways to defend systems.

Back in my college days, I read Art of Deception by Kevin Mitnick, I’d been curious about how things work and started developing "out of the box" mindset. So my tutors thought I was always "up to something"🤭 and after my computer account got blocked for exploring a little too deeply, I had to explain that I wasn’t trying to cause trouble - I just really wanted to learn how systems behave (and misbehave).😇 That curiosity eventually led me into cybersecurity.

Today, I work on real-world cybersecurity challenges.🚀

This blog is my space to share practical lessons from the field - techniques, tools, scripts, and strategies that help make security smarter and stronger. I hope you find something here that sparks ideas, brings clarity, or opens a few new rabbit holes worth exploring.

Thanks for stopping by.☺️
